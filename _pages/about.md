---

I obtained my MASc. from the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) advised by [Prof. Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/). I mostly worked on Continual Learning and Recommender Systems during my master collaborating with [LG AI Research](https://www.lgresearch.ai/).

Prior to that, I  completed my BASc. in [Engineering Science](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto, where I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Erkang Zhu](http://ekzhu.com/).

I interned at [Pitney Bowes](https://www.pitneybowes.com/us) as a machine learning engineer in 2019. During my undergrad, I spent a year at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en) as a software engineer intern.
